					People's utility token(PUT) foundation will be established to support
					and promote the development and adoption of PUT. The foundation will
					also support the development of PUT by funding and managing
					development teams, sponsoring hackathons and other events to encourage
					innovation, and providing technical resources and support to
					developers. Generally the Foundation would be the charity arm of the
					project. Where Empowerment and giving back to the people and
					communities will be the primary objective Objectives of PUT Foundation
					Empowerment: the team envisaged giving by to people in kinds through,
					empowerment to artisans, such as tools for Salon owners, Furniture
					stores, plumbers, Artist etc. Scholarships and grants: PUT Foundation
					would synchronize scholarship benefits to indigent but aspiring
					students and grants to the less privileged, widows and orphans. Giving
					back to the community is a veritable means of wealth distributions,
					value addition to people and alleviating poverty. The results of these
					to the projects community cannot be imagined. Also at the centre of
					PUT Foundation is the metropolitan green crusade. It's on record that
					people generate pollution more at the urban cities and metropolitans
					hence the project will adopt the business of tree planting. This will
					have a direct impact on humanity and the environment.
