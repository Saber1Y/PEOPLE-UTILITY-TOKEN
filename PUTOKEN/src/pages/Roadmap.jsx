					Massive Online Publicity After kick-starting the offline publicity,
					the second stage of the project road map is to vigorously market PUT
					online, deploying every available channel. More Listing: We also
					intend to list PUT on two more exchanges during this phase. This will
					also give more publicity to the project and give PUT holders more
					options for exchange.

					foundation shall take care of the humanity programs of the project and
					other essential aspects of the project that fall under its

					The second audit of PUT will be conducted during this stage. We need
					to establish the possibility of making adjustments to the road map to
					align with the instant reality of the project. And so programs
					arranged for each stage may be unevenly implemented.
