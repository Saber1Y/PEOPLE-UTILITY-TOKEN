						Dentro is derived from the Greek word “∆evtpo” meaning “The Tree”
						and Dentro Project takes its root from the consideration of TREE as
						a crucial element necessary to the survival of our earth and all the
						livings that inhabit it. In mythologies, Tree represents life,
						growth and by extension, the wisdom, power and prosperity.
						Therefore, Dentro Project is all about saving our planet earth, the
						lives within and the prosperity of all. Earth is ours. Humans, by
						virtue of diverse capabilities as endowed, may travel to the space
						and explore other planets, but the starting and returning points are
						still the earth planet, for nowhere is more designed for human
						living than earth. The advent of modernization and industrialization
						has never impacted our planet more than now. The increasing
						emissions of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, deforestation and
						human extractive activities that turned our once blooming forests to
						deserts, have led to the increasing carbons with all its attendant
						consequences. Government of the world and all stakeholders are
						concerned about the Climate Change. The United Nations efforts at
						curbing the impact of climate change are on increase. The
						consideration of alternative energy sources by developed and
						developing economies is evident in various government budgets. All
						these affirm the necessity to save our world for ourselves. At prime
						level, is human activities that plundered our forests. It is
						estimated that the land space equals the size of Panama is lost to
						deforestation annually, and it if continues at this rate, our earth
						may be unsafe to live in the next hundred years. Dentro project, as
						a charity deal to be undertaken by Dentro Foundation, targets
						revival of forests, by promoting plant of reserve trees, greening of
						metropolis, establishment of forest and games reserves and other
						activities that will reinforce the realization of re-greening goal
						of the project Therefore, in order to achieve and sustain this
						planet re-greening goal, the project envisions a phenomenon which
						will give birth to numerous establishments that will operate
						business across various industries, from which gains yearly grants
						may be secured to continually funding the re-greening efforts of the
						Dentro Foundation, hence the DentroBiz. DentroBiz is the arm of
						Dentro Project which fronts the establishment of businesses;
						restaurant chains, supermarket chains, hotels, resorts, plantations,
						recreational centers, malls, real estates, oil and gas as well as
						communication services. Through DentroBiz, parallel organisations
						will be created to further the use of the project token-Dentrocoin
						and advance its adoption and popularity. DentroBiz is the bedrock of
						the Independence for Crypto Economy which is the second purpose of
						Dentro Project.
