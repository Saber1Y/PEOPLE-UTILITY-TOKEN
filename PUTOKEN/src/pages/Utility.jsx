					People utility token as a utility asset will be proof- of-stake, where
					holders can stake the token for a period of time and earn rewards of
					stake. The systemic plan is that annual stake of above 5million PUT
					will attract annual reward 10% PUT, Another utility of People utility
					token(PUT) is the envisioned creation of a multi chain blockchain on
					which people utility token will sit. The blockchain interface will be
					devoid of scalability chain to chain transaction will be super fast,
					thereby fixing the problem of queuing in transaction and making
					transactions happen in real time. As a multi chain, the blockchain
					will be a solid and friendly base for other crypto projects to
					launch,we will create a robust,flexible and users attracting
					ecosystem. Peer to peer: Among the utilities of PUT is that users of
					the token will be able to transact without third party.PUT will be
					easily exchanged with most other native currencies of countries, also
					with other tokens and coins As the native token of people wallet and
					PUT blockchain PUT will be a means of transaction between crypto
					projects. Transaction fees( Gas fees) will be in People's utility
					token in the future development.
